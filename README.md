# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Engine 

### Key Components of an HFT Engine

  1. Market Data Handler: This component receives and processes real-time market data.
  2. Strategy Engine: This component contains the trading logic and generates buy/sell signals.
  3. Order Manager: This component sends orders to the exchange and manages order states.
